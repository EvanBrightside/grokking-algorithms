Arrays and Linked lists
- Linked lists are great if you’re going to read all the items one at a time: you can read one item, follow the address to the next item, and so on. But if you’re going to keep jumping around, linked lists are terrible.

- Arrays: Reading O(1) Insertion: O(n)
- Lists:  Reading O(n) Insertion: O(1)

- Insertion: Lists are better if you want to insert elements into the middle.
- Deletion: Lists are better, because you just need to change what the previous element points to
