## O(log n)

## 1.1 Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you're searching through it using binary search.
## What's the maximum number of steps it would take?
# log2(128) = 7

## 1.2 Suppose you double the size of the list. What's the maximum number of steps now?
# log2(256) = 8

## 1.3 You have a name, and you want to find the persond's phone number in the phone book.
# O(log n)

## 1.4 You have a phone number, and you want to find the persond's name in the phone book.
## (Hint: Youd'll have to search through the whole book!)
# O(n)

## 1.5 You want to read the numbers of every person in the phone book.
# O(n)

## 1.6 You want to read the numbers of just the As. (This is a tricky one! It involves concepts that are covered
## more in chapter 4. Read the answerâ€”you may be surprised!)
# O(n)
